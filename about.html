                      Hello there! <br />I'm Adaobi, a web developer with a
                      passion for art, a knack for UX design and a background in
                      psychology. I believe my unique perspective, combining
                      psychology and design, allows me to create a visually
                      appealing and user-friendly web experience. When I'm not
                      coding, I'm either studying or expressing myself through
                      painting and other creative projects. The desire to learn
                      coding has been with me since my early high school days,
                      so finally taking this leap brings joy and satisfaction to
                      my inner child. This project has been an incredible
                      journey, and I'm excited to continue exploring
                      opportunities to expand my skill set alongside my
                      classmates-turned-friends in the dynamic world of tech.
                      So, get ready to experience our project FaceTogether
                      Skincare, where we prioritize your skin and self-care
                      above all else! <br />
                      Welcome to the world of FaceTogether!<br />
                      Warmest regards,<br />

                      Meet Robert Huggans, a determined single father from Saint
                      Louis, MO who embarked on a life-changing journey to
                      Dallas, TX in pursuit of fresh opportunities. Fueled by an
                      unwavering desire for personal happiness and career
                      elevation, he embraces the challenges that come with
                      exploring new horizons in the IT industry. When not
                      immersed in the world of technology, Robert finds solace
                      in his love for travel, continuously seeking new
                      experiences and creating memories with his two daughters.
                      As he navigates his way through life, he also finds joy in
                      discovering and listening to new music, which serves as a
                      source of inspiration and motivation on his path to
                      success in Dallas.
                      <br />
                      After collaborating with classmates on a final project,
                      what initially began as an assignment has blossomed into a
                      thriving skincare venture. Robert has taken on a more
                      hands-on role in the company's product selection
                      department. Despite being relatively new to this specific
                      area of focus, he has fully immersed himself in the
                      process, eager to learn and contribute.

                      dynamic individual driven by a passion for personal growth
                      and making a positive impact on the world. With a love for
                      traveling, I thrive in eating exotic food, exploring new

                      studying became a new hobby of mine and in the process of

                      Welcome to our team project of skincare and I hope it
                      brings a smile to your face that will help with good
                      skincare!!!<br /><br />
                      Originally I proposed we do travel snacks as our product
                      but skincare won on a coin flip online unfortunately. I
                      was going to travel the world to find snacks as our
                      product. Now I’ll have to find skincare products while
                      eating travel snacks :)

                      I am a proud native of Sao Paulo, Brazil. I have always
                      had a passion for technology and pursued my interest in
                      the field by studying mechanical and electronics
                      engineering. In 2015, I earned my degree in civil
                      engineering and went on to work as a technician at the
                      railway in Sao Paulo for over a decade. However, my thirst
                      for knowledge and love for technology never waned. In
                      2022, I decided to expand my skill set and studied cloud
                      computing, earning a certification in AWS Cloud
                      Practitioner. This experience further ignited my curiosity
                      and interest in the technology industry, leading me to
                      pursue web development full-stack. Currently, I am in the
                      process of completing my certificate in web development
                      full-stack, and I am thrilled to embark on a new career
                      path. My team and I had a lot of fun and hardworking doing
                      this project, and we're really proud of it,<br />
                      Guilherme dos Santos.
